      Hi! I’m Lola, I write poems and build web things. 
      Like most toddlers, I learnt to write when I was about 3 and haven’t stopped since. 18yrs after conquering pen holding, I accidentally fell in love with coding and have been on a quest to learn and teach as much as possible.

    <p class="lh-copy measure">
      I‘m a published poet via my self (<em>#000000</em>)and Eyewear Poetry (<em>Lost and Found</em>). <em>Lost and Found</em> was selected as the 2016 Poetry Book Society's spring pamphlet. I run an organisation, <span class="courier">blackgirl.tech</span>, that aims to provide a safe space for girls and women of colour to learn more about tech and how to code.
